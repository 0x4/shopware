/*
Mixins
==================================================
The `mixins.less` file contains the imports to all mixin documents that simplify the work with shopware.

More precise designations are commented inside the documents.

Mixins can be used by adding the mixin class onto an element inside shopware.

**Example:**<br/>
`.border-radius(3px);`
